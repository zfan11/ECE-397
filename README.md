# ECE-397
This is the GitHub repository for the ECE397 course created by Zhengjie, intended to document the code and test cases for the replication of the REPET technique and Drum Extraction technique.
`Test Case 01 Vocal + Track 20240715.mp3` is the input audio for this code. It is a band arrangement created using loops, with the latter part containing the vocals of the lead singer.
`drum_extraction.wav` is the drum audio extracted from the input audio using this code.
